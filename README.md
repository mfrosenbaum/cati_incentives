# Remote Survey Modes Metaanalysis
This repo contains a quick meta-analysis of CATI incentives for IPA RECOVR. 

The `01_estimate_cati_incentive_effects.do` file scrapes response rates from the [Remote Surveying in a Pandemic: Research Synthesis Source Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lPLW9hsMur0bIqFy7QcoFMKU5CHnhcVDke0EmwYDp7w/edit#gid=304366966), adds in less precise outcome estimates from papers in the sheet that are not reported in the response rate tab, and then estimates pooled estimates for incentives in 2020 USD.
